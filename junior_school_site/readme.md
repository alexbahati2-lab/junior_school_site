🏫 Heroes Academy Website

A modern and dynamic school website built with Django and HTML/CSS, designed for Heroes Academy — where every child is a hero in the making.

This site allows visitors to learn about the school, view galleries and upcoming events, and gives the Director a hidden admin portal to manage content directly from the site.

🚀 Features
🧩 Public Pages

Home Page — Displays the school’s mission, background slideshow of gallery photos, and highlights upcoming events.

About Page — Showcases the teachers and general school background.

Gallery Page — Displays school photos dynamically uploaded by the director.

Contact Page — Contains basic school contact information.

Events Page — Lists upcoming school events with descriptions, dates, and optional images.

From here, the Director can:

🏠 Edit the Home page content

🏫 Update the About page

All without needing to log into Django’s backend panel.
